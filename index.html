What attracts me the most to you is you. Your way of looking at life. The way you perceive things people and everyone around. Every coin has two sides and you are my flip side. The confidence you hold the way you believe in yourself and the accuracy with which you analyse a situation. Me to you but more than that it's the honesty. It's like if you are serious about something, you will upfront address it and if you are not you will not play games. I can't see your 100% honest but yes I can make that 80%. Fairly hi to draw me to you.

So let's start with what attracts me to you like it 20 mark question. In no particular order please read the following:

1. The Eyes: small sharp and brown in the sun.
2. The way you look: short beard, beautiful shoulders and a little blush to make you pink.
3. Presence: the way you make eye contact, the way you look at the right moment in the right directions, the subtle moments of a half smile and the movements of the hands, the pull at the right time and the tilt from the right side. The right observations and the perfect reactions. Humor, filmy lines, flirting without being cheesy, thoughtfulness in the moment, present. You just being present is charming and attracting in itself. Totally alive and surrounding the mind.
4. Your Touch: you exactly know where to touch upon whether physical or emotional. The rest, the shoulder, the familiarity and oh boy boy the humour or may I call it sarcasm or maybe roast.
5. Intellect: you have a very different perspective and take on a lot of things than me. You read things really well and understand them and even think about the steps further. It goes beyond saying that "You know your shit" LOL XOXO.

I can go on, there is literally so much more—relationships, emotional maturity and loads more—but I hope you know how that my # questions a lot and tell a lot to maybe sure enough to say yes to you.

So yes Mr Bakliwal you are very attractive and I am totally mesmerized by you.

-Love  
Vinoti Sethia

Hi!!

Wohooo! Crazy stupid love I must say. So much passed by in so many days, our parents met, I tried for three long days and so much more. So here is me writing all about this collectively. You’re indeed special to me in my life. Clearly, standing up against all odds is hard, and I do that so easily with the thought of having you in my mind, crazy Kalshu.

Let's start with meeting your parents. Sweet, simple people—but papa tumhare pateli hai on first impressions—and mom sweet but super street smart. Right cards, right time, and knows how to get her stuff done. Impressive. I don’t know expressive well, that’s a long story to tell.

Love,  
Vinoti`

Hi,

I know this is a very random thought but a strong intuition that I had today. Kalash Bakliwal Sr. Counsel, Bombay High Court — I firmed this at 9:04 a.m. and I know this will happen someday soon and I am very grateful for this feeling. So I can be Anushka Sharma cheering for my guy with the widest smile on my face and hands clapping, enjoying that gown and the Bombay Bar Association.

I honestly did not know if I was going to continue writing, but I guess things are different. All I want to tell you this morning is I love you and I want to see you soar miles, my dear love and the Senior Counsel Mr. Kalash Bakliwal.

Love,

Hi,

Last few weeks have been stressful, the things at home have been tough but the most beautiful part of all this is that I could still talk to you. At no point did I feel that I needed to stop, halt, or even feel the need to stay silent.

I am very happy and excited—we’re going to make it official soon. That beautiful feeling, a feeling strong and inscribed in me, is waiting to celebrate, enjoy a new start, and a beautiful journey with you.

Hello Hero,

Two States is difficult as much as it seems beautiful. It’s like being crushed between two extremely strong, culturally held-up minds and family. I love it when I am with you and how beautiful life feels in little things, but the moment I switch towards my parents, I enter a room of fear and wildness.

I don't know if I am a joint-family girl or not—maybe not, to be honest. There are just so many things against my thoughts that you have to balance. I don't know if I will be able to take that stride ahead. It's a down time honestly, but trust me, the only person I see who can handle this with me is you.

Thank you—like I say, each day I am grateful for you, not just today but every single day. Sharing complications and issues, I hope to have you by my side forever so that all that we have been standing up for and with comes true in the most beautiful way possible.

Thank you for being my confidant and letting me unleash myself truly so that I don't feel clustered and compact. You know I love you, and cheers to the soon-to-be. I know it’s going to be official very soon!

Loads of love to you.`, imageUrl: "https://i.postimg.cc/qMdt8B6h/Whats-App-Image-2025-12-30-at-01-35-36.jpg" },

Hello,

I know I am writing after so long and that's why this maybe becomes a long letter, but never mind. So we had a beautiful roka ceremony, and while things felt scary with ups and downs, we are now officially a part of each other’s WhatsApp groups. Slowly, we have intertwined the families, now each other, and things have walked ahead so much.

I remember being a bride jilla in the morning, not able to do my hair properly, and coming to your house with you felt awkward and blushful at the same time. I do remember my family being all ten and doing their own thing, but eventually being happy. One moment we are just passengers, the next we are part of the crowd.

The most beautiful surprise of my life till date—I did not once think that you might get a tattoo. I did think, why is he looking so ajeeb, why is he wearing full sleeves? Vinoti to her mind: “chod, hoga kuchh… dhulne mein dalni hogi to pahan li hogi.” Honestly, it’s a symbol that reminds me every time I look at it how special and lucky I am to be in someone’s life. Even today, I glide my thumb at least once over it when I meet you so that the vibrations pass through me.

Now coming to my fairy-tale dream come true—the opening of the bag in the train, a surprise, and never expected. Life felt like I was in total overdrive. Wrong assumptions and fantasies coming to reality, details so beautifully chosen, and what timing to gift “All Things Bright and Beautiful.” For someone like me who expected the bare minimum, you raised the standards high enough for me to feel blushed and awed at the same time in front of my mother and my bua.

Let’s call this a bhelpuri—my stomach ingredients all at once, but tasting absolutely beautiful.`, imageUrl: "https://i.postimg.cc/2jQMSTQr/Whats_App_Image_2025_12_30_at_01_34_52.jpg" },

Hiii Kalashu,

As this year ends and we move ahead to this new beginning of life from tomorrow, I just want to say I am grateful to this year for everything it has done for me. The good days, the growth days—every day was special.

I promise you that the new year shall be the next phase, the new life… the beginning of Kahani in KAVI KI KAHANI. The year ends in my 25-year-long bed but wakes up to a beautiful journey of you by my side.

Like I always say, I will always have your back no matter what, how, and when. So my dear groom-to-be, I hope you enjoyed the wedding—the ups, downs, and this peak of the rollercoaster before its drop.

I am grateful for you and the OG Mr. and Mrs. Bakliwal. Never did I think I would get a boy who would love me so unconditionally. I always thought I have too many toxic traits to be handled, but you proved them all wrong by standing beside me, making sure I get everything I say, and knowing how to make things fall in place for me.

I am not afraid of new beginnings, but this one is a bit scary—in a way, if I will meet your expectations as a wife. It will be beautiful, I know… just a matter of time. Excited, and with every single breath, walking towards you, for you.

I love you, my Hero. I years back and to date want to marry you so bad. Hello, Husband!
Hope you are feeling beautiful this week.

I promise to keep loving you.

Yours,
Bride to be in 4 days
